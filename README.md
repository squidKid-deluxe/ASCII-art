# ASCII art generators

There are currently three ASCII generators, 

- color images
- black and white light theme
- black and white dark theme 

FIXME: the images dictionary must be edited manually to incorporate new images.

NOTE:To edit the size of the printed image, raise or lower the number `image.height` (line 45) is being divided by. ***

To use the scripts, run them and enter the image you want to convert.

`ascii_art.py` and `ascii_art_bl_wh.py` use only unicode characters.
